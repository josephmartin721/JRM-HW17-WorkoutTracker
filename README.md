# JRM-HW17-WorkoutTracker

# Project Purpose

This project was intended to test the student's ability to use mongo/mongoose in order to maintain a basic workout tracking app.

# User Story

-- As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
